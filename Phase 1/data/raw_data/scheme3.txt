**Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Yojana (PMJJBY)** is a flagship life insurance scheme introduced by the Government of India to provide financial security and life insurance coverage to individuals, particularly in the low-income segments of society. The scheme is part of the government's larger objective to ensure the welfare and well-being of its citizens, especially those who are most vulnerable in case of unforeseen events like death. PMJJBY is intended to provide affordable life insurance coverage to a large section of India's population, and its design ensures that it is accessible to people with varying income levels, making it one of the most inclusive insurance schemes in the country.

### 1. **Overview of the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Yojana (PMJJBY):**

The **Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Yojana (PMJJBY)** is a government-backed life insurance scheme that offers a **life insurance cover of Rs. 2 lakh** in case of the death of the insured person. The scheme aims to provide financial security to the families of low-income individuals who may struggle with the loss of their primary breadwinner. The scheme offers an affordable premium structure, making it accessible to people across various economic strata, especially those in the unorganized and rural sectors of India.

The scheme was launched on **May 9, 2015**, by the Indian government as part of its mission to expand financial inclusion in the country. PMJJBY is also seen as a means of improving the insurance penetration in India, which remains relatively low compared to other countries. This scheme is aimed at offering a **financial safety net** to individuals and their families, ensuring that they are not burdened by financial distress in the event of a sudden death.

### 2. **Eligibility Criteria for PMJJBY:**

In order to participate in the **Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Yojana (PMJJBY)**, individuals need to meet specific eligibility criteria. These criteria ensure that the scheme is available to those who need it most, and helps avoid potential misuse of the scheme.

**Eligibility Criteria:**

1. **Indian Citizenship:** The scheme is designed exclusively for **Indian citizens**. Non-Indian citizens, such as foreigners residing in India, are not eligible to apply for the scheme. This ensures that only Indian nationals benefit from this social security initiative.

2. **Age Group:** To be eligible for PMJJBY, individuals must fall within the age group of **18 to 50 years**. This age range is carefully chosen to ensure that individuals who are in the working age group and may have dependents are covered. The age of 18 years is the minimum threshold for enrolling in the scheme, while the upper age limit is set at 50 years. This means that individuals who are between the ages of 18 and 50 can enroll in the scheme, but those over the age of 50 are not eligible.

3. **Bank Account and Aadhaar Requirement:** Participants must have an active **Jandhan account or a savings bank account** linked with **Aadhaar**. This is a critical requirement for ensuring that the scheme is accessible to individuals, particularly in rural and unbanked areas, where bank account access might be limited. The Aadhaar card ensures a reliable and tamper-proof identity verification process, and linking it with the bank account ensures seamless and efficient premium payments.

4. **Auto-Debit Consent:** Enrollment in the scheme requires **auto-debit consent** from the bank account holder. This means that once the individual agrees to participate in the scheme, their premiums will be automatically debited from their linked bank account every year. This system makes it easier for individuals to make their premium payments on time, without the need for manual intervention or reminders.

### 3. **Benefits of PMJJBY:**

The primary benefit of the **Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Yojana (PMJJBY)** is the **life insurance coverage** it provides in the event of the death of the insured individual. However, there are several other features and advantages that make the scheme highly beneficial for its target demographic:

**1. Life Insurance Coverage of Rs. 2 Lakh:**

The central benefit of PMJJBY is that it provides a life insurance cover of **Rs. 2 lakh** to the beneficiary or nominee of the insured individual in the event of their death. The insurance amount is paid irrespective of the cause of death, whether it is natural, accidental, or due to any other cause. This lump sum payout is intended to provide financial support to the family of the deceased, helping them cover expenses and cope with the loss of income from the deceased breadwinner.

**2. Affordability of Premium:**

One of the key features of PMJJBY is its **affordability**. The scheme has been specifically designed to cater to the lower-income segments of the population. The annual premium for the scheme is **extremely low**, costing only **Rs. 330 per year**. This premium can be easily paid through the auto-debit facility linked to the individual’s bank account. Given the minimal premium, the scheme offers great value for individuals who would not typically be able to afford high premiums associated with traditional life insurance policies.

**3. Simplified Enrollment Process:**

Enrollment in the scheme is straightforward, and individuals can easily enroll in PMJJBY through their bank. The linking of the Aadhaar card with the savings account helps simplify the process, and banks provide the necessary infrastructure to allow individuals to join the scheme with ease. This is particularly beneficial for individuals who may not have access to a wide range of financial services and products.

**4. Financial Security for Families:**

For families that depend on a single breadwinner, the sudden loss of the individual can be devastating, both emotionally and financially. PMJJBY offers peace of mind by ensuring that families will have access to a **Rs. 2 lakh insurance payout** in case of death, thereby reducing the financial strain and helping them maintain a certain standard of living.

**5. No Medical Examination Required:**

Unlike many traditional life insurance policies, which require a **medical examination** before policy issuance, PMJJBY does not require any medical checks or health-related information. This makes it more accessible to individuals who may not have access to medical facilities or who may not be able to afford medical tests. The scheme is designed to be inclusive and to offer coverage to as many people as possible.

**6. Automatic Renewal:**

PMJJBY comes with the option of **automatic renewal** each year, as long as the premium is successfully debited from the bank account. This ensures continuous coverage for the individual, without the need for frequent renewals or re-enrollments. The automatic renewal process helps avoid the accidental lapse of the policy, ensuring that beneficiaries remain protected at all times.

### 4. **Key Features of the Scheme:**

The **Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Yojana (PMJJBY)** has several features that make it attractive and practical for a wide segment of the population:

- **Premium Payment Mode:** The premiums are deducted **automatically via auto-debit** from the linked bank account annually. This makes it convenient for the individual, as they do not need to manually pay their premiums.
  
- **Policy Tenure:** The policy provides **coverage for one year**, but it can be renewed every year as long as the individual continues to meet the eligibility requirements.
