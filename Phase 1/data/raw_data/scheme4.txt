**Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY)** is an essential social welfare initiative launched by the Government of India to provide financial protection to individuals in case of accidental injuries or death. The scheme is designed to offer a low-cost insurance solution that protects citizens, especially those in lower-income groups, from financial hardship caused by accidents. Through this scheme, the government aims to increase insurance coverage and financial inclusion among the Indian population, particularly for those who might not be able to afford traditional insurance policies.

### 1. **Overview of Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY):**

The **Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY)** provides **affordable accident insurance** to Indian citizens between the ages of **18 and 70 years**. This scheme offers protection against accidental death, disability, and injury at an extremely low premium, which makes it accessible to a large section of the Indian population. The scheme covers **accidental death** and **full disability** with a risk coverage of **Rs. 2 lakh**, while it offers **Rs. 1 lakh** coverage for **partial disability** resulting from an accident. By providing an easy and cost-effective way to secure financial protection, PMSBY aims to reduce the economic burden on families in case of such unforeseen events.

Launched in **2015** by Prime Minister Narendra Modi under the government's **financial inclusion program**, the scheme targets low-income groups, particularly those who have minimal access to formal financial services. The aim is to offer them the peace of mind that their families will have some financial support if something happens to them due to an accident.

### 2. **Eligibility Criteria for PMSBY:**

In order to avail of the benefits of PMSBY, individuals must meet specific eligibility criteria. These criteria ensure that the scheme reaches the intended demographic while maintaining the integrity of the system.

**Eligibility Criteria:**

1. **Indian Citizenship:** The scheme is available only to **Indian citizens**. Non-resident Indians (NRIs) and foreign nationals are not eligible for this insurance scheme. This helps to ensure that the scheme’s benefits are directed toward the Indian population, particularly the economically weaker sections.

2. **Age Group:** Individuals must be between the ages of **18 and 70 years** to enroll in the scheme. This age range ensures that the scheme provides insurance to people in their working years, who are most likely to be engaged in activities with a higher risk of accidents. The minimum age of 18 ensures that only individuals who are legally adults can sign up, while the upper age limit of 70 ensures that elderly individuals, who may be more vulnerable to accidents, can also be covered under the scheme.

3. **Bank Account and Aadhaar Linkage:** To apply for PMSBY, applicants must have an **active Jandhan or savings bank account** that is linked with **Aadhaar**. The linkage of Aadhaar ensures proper identification and reduces fraud, while the use of bank accounts ensures that premiums can be collected automatically through the **auto-debit** feature. This mechanism makes it easier for individuals to maintain their insurance coverage year after year.

4. **Auto-Debit Consent:** Enrollment in the scheme requires **auto-debit consent** from the participant's bank account. This feature ensures that the premium is paid automatically from the bank account at the time of renewal, making it easier for policyholders to continue their coverage without manual intervention.

### 3. **Benefits of PMSBY:**

The Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana offers financial protection to individuals against accidents, which may cause loss of life, permanent disability, or partial disability. The scheme is designed to reduce the financial burden on families who suffer due to accidents and ensure that individuals who may not have access to traditional insurance are still covered.

**1. Accidental Death and Full Disability Coverage of Rs. 2 Lakh:**

The primary benefit of PMSBY is its coverage in case of **accidental death** or **full disability**. If an individual meets with an accident resulting in death or permanent total disability (where the individual is left completely disabled and unable to work), the nominee or the insured person is entitled to a **Rs. 2 lakh insurance payout**. This amount serves as financial support to the family of the deceased or to the insured person who has lost the ability to work due to the accident. 

This coverage is especially important for families that rely on a single income source, as it ensures they do not face financial difficulties in the absence of the breadwinner.

**2. Partial Disability Coverage of Rs. 1 Lakh:**

In the case of **partial disability**, where the individual experiences an injury that partially disables them but does not result in complete inability to work, the scheme provides a coverage of **Rs. 1 lakh**. Partial disability can include injuries such as the loss of a limb, loss of vision in one eye, or other injuries that affect an individual’s ability to perform certain tasks but not all activities. This financial compensation helps the individual to cope with the loss of income or the increased medical expenses associated with rehabilitation.

**3. Extremely Low Premium:**

One of the standout features of PMSBY is its affordability. The annual premium for this insurance scheme is just **Rs. 12 per year**, which is deducted from the bank account linked with the scheme via the auto-debit mechanism. This nominal amount ensures that even individuals in the lower-income brackets, including workers in the informal sector, can avail themselves of the benefits of the scheme. By offering such an affordable option, the government makes accident insurance accessible to a vast number of people who may otherwise not have been able to afford conventional insurance policies.

**4. Simplified Enrollment and Claim Process:**

The enrollment process for PMSBY is simple, requiring minimal documentation. An individual only needs to have a **valid Aadhaar card**, a **bank account**, and the ability to give **auto-debit consent** for premium payments. Additionally, the **claim process** is straightforward, and the **claim amount** is paid directly to the nominee or the insured individual’s bank account in the case of death or disability. This direct payment system ensures a fast and hassle-free claims process.

**5. Automatic Renewal:**

Once an individual has enrolled in the scheme, the **auto-debit** feature ensures that the premium is paid every year automatically, without the need for the individual to manually renew the policy. This ensures continuous coverage and reduces the chances of accidental lapses in insurance due to missed payments.

### 4. **Key Features of PMSBY:**

The **Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY)** comes with several features that make it accessible and beneficial for individuals, particularly those in economically weaker sections of society:

- **Premium Payment Mode:** The premium is automatically deducted from the insured individual’s linked bank account. This system ensures that the policyholder does not have to remember to make annual payments, thereby ensuring continuous coverage.

- **Simple and Transparent Process:** The enrollment process is simple and transparent. Individuals can enroll by visiting their bank branch or online banking portal, and the claim process is straightforward with minimal documentation.

- **Renewal of Policy:** The policy automatically renews every year, as long as the premium is paid via auto-debit. The renewal process ensures that the insured remains covered throughout the year without having to actively engage in the renewal process.

- **Wide Accessibility:** The scheme is available through **all banks** that participate in the scheme, which increases its accessibility, especially in rural and remote areas.

- **Inclusion of Low-Income Groups:** The scheme specifically targets the low-income and informal sector workers, ensuring that individuals who may not have access to traditional insurance options can still protect themselves and their families from financial risk due to accidents.

### 5. **Conclusion:**
